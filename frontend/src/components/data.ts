    about: `Neeraj Chopra recently made headlines by securing a silver medal in the
            men's javelin event at the Paris Olympics 2024. He achieved a throw of
            89.45 meters, marking a season-best performance. Despite his impressive
            throw, he was narrowly edged out by Pakistan's Arshad Nadeem, who won
            gold with a throw of 92.97 meters. This was a significant moment as
            Nadeem's win marked Pakistan's first individual Olympic gold. Neeraj's
            silver continues his streak of excellence following his historic gold at
            the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.`,

    about: `Indian wrestler Vinesh Phogat has announced her retirement after a shocking disqualification from the Paris Olympics 2024. Phogat, who was competing in the 50 kg women's wrestling category, was disqualified just before the gold medal bout due to being overweight by 100 grams. This disqualification led her to withdraw from the competition, despite having performed impressively up until that point.
      
      Phogat has also appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, seeking a joint silver medal for the event, with the decision expected soon.`,
